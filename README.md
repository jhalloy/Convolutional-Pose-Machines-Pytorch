# Convolutional-Pose-Machines-Pytorch 

This is a PyTorch version of Convolutional Pose Machines, you can find more details in the original paper [Convolutional Pose Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00134.pdf)

## Results

The result is generated by the model, which has trained 100 epochs.

## Requirements

* Python 3.12
* PyTorch 2.5.1
* torchvision 0.20.1
* OpenCv 4.11.0

## The data set

* Download the data set for training [ LSPet ](https://github.com/axelcarlier/lsp) - I downloaded as zip and then extracted to ./dataset/lspet_dataset/
* Download the data set for validation [ LSP ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dkrivosic/leeds-sports-pose-lsp) - I downloaded as a zip and extracted to ./dataset/lsp_dataset/
* When you want to train some other datasets, please change the code to correspond to your datasets.

## Usage

### Train

* Set the train parameters in " config/config.yml ".
* Go to the "train_val" folder ` cd train_val `.
* #### with val
```bash
python cpm_train.py --gpu 0 --train_dir ../dataset/lspet_dataset --val_dir ../dataset/lsp_dataset --config ../config/config.yml
```
* #### without val
```bash
python cpm_train.py --gpu 0 --train_dir ../dataset/lspet_dataset --config ../config/config.yml
```
- You can also train the model like
```bash
sudo sh cpm_train.sh
```

### Test

* Go to the "test" folder ` cd test `.
```bash
python cpm_test.py
```

### Pre-trained model
* [ cpm_checkpoint_pth.tar--Baiduyun Password: huaj ](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11mTCfgJyhYlpBfB4inTC9g)

## Notice
* The code of test is just used for visualization, you can change the code to test your own images on condition that you have trained another model "person-center-network" (similar to CPMs).
* I hope that'll be helpful for you.
